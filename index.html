  <h1>Welcome to My DevOps Journey</h1>

  <p>
    Hi! I’m <strong>Abhir Naik</strong>, a Computer Science and Business Administration student at Northeastern University, concentrating in FinTech. 
    I’m passionate about the intersection of software engineering, automation, and cloud infrastructure—essentially, everything that makes modern DevOps so exciting.
    <br><br>
    Over the year, I’ve worked extensively with technologies such as <strong>AWS</strong> (EC2, Lambda, ECR, EventBridge, and VPC), <strong>OpenTofu/Terraform</strong> for infrastructure as code, 
    and <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> and <strong>Atlantis</strong> for CI/CD automation. What I love about DevOps is how it blends development with operations to improve speed, 
    reliability, and scalability across software systems.
    <br><br>
    Beyond professional experience, I’ve built my own <a href="projects.html">home lab</a> to simulate real-world cloud environments. It’s where I experiment with 
    containerized applications, monitoring, and continuous deployment workflows. My goal is to continue learning how to design robust cloud infrastructures and help teams 
    build automated, secure, and scalable systems.
