  <h2>My Home Lab Project</h2>

  <img src="homelab-setup.jpg" alt="My home lab setup" class="main-img">

  <p>
    My home lab is my personal sandbox for experimenting with DevOps workflows and cloud technologies. 
    I started it as a way to apply what I was learning at Babbage Insight and IntelNeuron LLC to a more controlled, hands-on environment. 
    Using an AWS EC2 instance and Docker, I created a simulated infrastructure where I can deploy and test services continuously.
    <br><br>
    I configured <strong>OpenTofu (Terraform fork)</strong> scripts to provision EC2 instances and networking resources automatically. 
    Once my infrastructure was up, I containerized several lightweight applications and orchestrated them with <strong>Docker Compose</strong>. 
    To automate builds and deployments, I set up a <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> pipeline that SSHs into my EC2 instance, pulls the latest code, and rebuilds Docker containers on every push.
    <br><br>
    This project also includes AWS monitoring through <strong>CloudWatch</strong> and cost tracking, helping me understand the practical challenges of running services efficiently. 
    Ultimately, the home lab gives me the flexibility to test new tools, break things safely, and deepen my understanding of scalable infrastructure automation.
